# FortiGate Virtual Firewall

If a computer is connected to the Internet connection, it is vulnerable to online attacks. The only difference is some computers could be more susceptible than others.

## Introduction

In the computing language, a firewall is a security software or hardware that can monitor and control network traffic, both incoming and outgoing. It establishes a kind of barrier between reliable internal and unknown external networks.

Therefore, a firewall, also known as a network firewall, is capable of preventing unauthorized access to/from private networks.

A network firewall is based on security rules to accept, reject, or drop specific traffic. The firewall aims to allow or deny the connection or request, depending on implemented rules.
